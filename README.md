# Tasks List React Project

The Tasks List React Project is a web app that stores newly created tasks and also allows the user to check off tasks while confirming whether they are completed or not.

## About

This project aims to iterate a portion of a previous project that I've worked on with a different web stack. I also consider this project an exercise that allowed me to experiment with tools and methods I never used before such as MongoDB, Redux, and an improved folder structure. Technologies include NodeJS, ExpressJS, and React.

MongoDB, Express, React, Redux, Node

## Installation and Preparation

Be sure to install MongoDB locally since this web app uses this database to modify data. The database's name should be "TaskList" and the collection is "tasks".
